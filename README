Quick and dirty project to print out the amount of effort left till my goals.
I want to know how much I need to improve given than I want to rest one of each four weeks
and the longest I have achieved so far.

You can run this software like:
```
ruby schedule.rb
```

You will need a achievements.yml in the same directory with contents like this:
```yaml
run:
  - { date: 2012-12-01,  distance: 10.0 }
  - { date: 2012-12-09,  distance: 13.7 }

bike:
  - { date: 2012-11-15, distance: 27.0 }

swim:
  - { date: 2012-11-25,  distance: 850 }
```
